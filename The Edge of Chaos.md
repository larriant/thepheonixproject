Overlooking technical definitions, entropy is a synonym for disorder, and you can take it to mean that throughout this post. A high entropy system has lots more ‘going on’ than an ordered one. On the one hand this disorder can lead to chaos (unpredictable, seemingly random behaviour), but on another it can lead to emergence (complex patterns that occur when elements of the system spontaneously come together in certain ways).

Emergence can occur in high entropy systems because there are more elements in the system, with a wider range of relationships, allowing new structures to emerge from the richness and diversity of the system. In this way disorder can be a doorway to creativity and evolution. Think about the difference in complexity and creativity between a violin duo playing classical music, and a 5-person jazz band improvising. The violin duo are low-entropy: they play a set piece with pre-planned, predictable melodies. The jazz band, however, have higher entropy: there are more instruments in the mix, and the musicians know how to use this higher disorder to catalyse spontaneous creativity. The saxophonist might hear a line by the pianist and repeat it with some variation, which inspires the guitarist to do the same. A minute later, the band might be riffing on some totally new melody, which nobody planned or foresaw: it emerged spontaneously from from the disorder! Crucially, to achieve this, the band will use a backbone of order (like a chord sequence that everyone is following) to guide their disorder towards interesting new melodies. They don’t want too much entropy, either, or they’d all be playing different things, so there must be a sweet spot between how ordered and how disordered they are that makes for the best spontaneous improvisation. This is the edge of chaos principle: the most complex patterns emerge when the system is not too chaotic, but not too ordered either.

From Designing Regenerative Cultures (Wahl): 

“The periodic, rhythmic dance between order and chaos, stability and transformation as a fundamental pattern of self-organisation in complex living systems.”

“The gradual or sudden breakdown of the old order and structures moves the system closer to the edge of chaos - the edge of its current stability (dynamic equilibrium) domain. The reorganisation of resource flows and changes in the quality and quantity of interconnections within the system at this point create a crisis that can be turned into an opportunity for transformation and innovation.”
