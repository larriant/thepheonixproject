# World Shattering Ideas

This is a place to record ideas that shatter your world. (and explain them in an accessible way)


I was thinking back on the past couple of months and wanted to make a list of the big ideas weâ€™ve had.

So here goes.

1. Emergentism (systems view) replacing emergentism
2. Map and the Territory (Meta/Rationality)
3. Rob Burbea Ways of Looking type of Spirituality.
4. Metaphysical monoculturing (Zak Stein)
5. Metamodernism (aka hanzi)

Would be great to try and explain each of these in a blog post. Or have a good pitch down for them at least.
