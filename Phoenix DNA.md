The universe is evolving towards the emergence of more and more complexity.

`what is complexity? what is emergence?`

If we trace the development of life from its earliest beginnings, we see a recurring fractal pattern of smaller parts coming together to form larger integrated wholes. 

This occurs through a process of dividing and unifying: a holon is formed which differentiates itself from others, while at the same time trying to co-operate and co-evolve with them, in order to survive. 

**First nature** describes life on earth before human civilisation when all things followed this teleology. It was a continuation of the universe evolving towards more and more complexity.

But then the PFC allowed humans to begin to create complex object systems. Which reduced the lived complexity of humanity. This lived complexity was then embodied in hierarchical systems such as patriarchy and class. This led to a **Second Nature** of life on earth.

`see entropic brain paper`
`how did second nature emerge?`
`how does emerge of second nature tie in with neuroscience?`
`What is the link between hierarchical social structures and dominance/ destruction of nature? Is this link causal or correlational (or both)? What other factors are at play (e.g. property)?`

The aim of The Phoenix Project is to return humanity to working in accordance with the principles of nature. To allow us to continue using our PFC objectification tool but for the good of the whole, at the edge of chaos.

If we can achieve this we will reach **Free Nature**. A world in which humans push the whole even further towards emergent complexity in a holistic way - including the PFC’s ability to dissect and rationalise. 

In order to achieve this we must learn to use the tool of ways of seeing in order to vastly increase the possible complexity of the repertoire of mental states you can inhabit in lived reality.

Improving our ability to freely use complex ways of seeings seems to be half of the struggle to get Gaia to free nature. Our minds/brains are active movements towards the global edge of chaos. 

The other half involves moving our social, economic and cultural systems towards coherence with the principle of emergent complexity.

Our ability to freely use ways of seeing is connected with the search for enlightenment. (Liquid mind)

Our ability to use more complex ways of seeing is connected with MHC developmental stage complexity and cultural code.

Individuals operating in this way are said to have a fluid mode.

Key Questions:
+ How did 2nd nature emerge in the brain? - READ Metzinger / Carhart Harris

+ How did 2nd nature emerge in society? - READ bookchin

+ How to synthesise brain and society changes in transition to 2nd nature?

+ How does ordered brain and social structures lead to the present meaning crisis? - WATCH Verveke

+ How does ordered brain and social structures lead to the domination and exploitation of nature and others?

+ How does that inform our quest for meaning / free nature / edge of chaos?

+ What principles and practices should our social, cultural and economic systems follow to allow us to achieve this?

+ How does meditation / ways of seeing lead to more edge of chaos mind?

+ How do development stage theories / metamodernism fit into this?

+ Better grasp of emergent complexity, complex systems and the edge of chaos itself. Difference between complexity and robust complexity? 

Still evolving questions:
+ What’s the relationship between Will to Power, Joyous Affect, Will to Live and Eros? (maybe read zach stein article again)
+ What are the attractors that pull us towards the edge of chaos?
+ What it actually means to be at the edge of chaos?
+ How does the development of neoliberalism relate to this? 

Our aim for this article was tot ie together:
+ Social Ecology
+ Edge of Chaos
+ Fluid Mode
+ Meaning
+ Meta-modernism
+ Ways of Seeing
+ The Transjective Perspective
+ Developmental Stage Theories
+ Eros
+ Enlightenment
+ Will to Power / Joyous Affect

At the edge of chaos, complex dynamic systems are at their most creative (Kauffman, 1995).
