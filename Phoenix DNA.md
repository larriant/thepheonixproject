The universe is evolving towards the emerge of more and more complexity.

If we trace the development of life from its earliest beginnings, we see a recurring pattern of smaller parts coming together to form larger integrated wholes. 

It does this through a process of dividing and unifying. A holon is formed which differentiates itself from others while at the same time trying to co-operate to survive. 

The **first nature** on earth before human civilisation following this teleology. It was a continuation of the universe evolving towards more and more complexity.

But then the PFC allowed humans to begin to create complex object systems. Which reduced the lived complexity of humanity. This lived complexity was then embodied in hierarchical systems such as patriarchy and class. This led to a **second nature** of life on earth.

The aim of The Phoenix Project is to return humanity to working in accordance with the principles of nature. To allow us to continue using our PFC objectification tool but for the good of the whole, at the edge of chaos.

If we can achieve this we will reach **free nature**. A world in which humans PFC is used to push the whole even further towards emergent complexity.

In order to achieve this we must learn to use the tool of ways of seeing in order to vastly increase the possible complexity of the repertoire of mental states you can inhabit in lived reality.

Improving our ability to freely use complex ways of seeings seems to be half of the struggle to get Gaia to free nature. 

The other half involves moving our social, economic and cultural systems towards coherence with the principle of emergent complexity.

Our ability to freely use ways of seeing is connected with the search for enlightenment. (Liquid mind)

Our ability to use more complex ways of seeing is connected with MHC developmental stage complexity and cultural code.

Individuals operating in this way are said to have a fluid mode.

Things still to tie into this picture:
+ How does meaning and the meaning crisis fit into the picture?
+ How does the meaning crisis drive the social crisis?
+ Whatâ€™s the relationship between Will to Power, Joyous Affect, Will to Live and Eros? (maybe read zach stein article again)
+ What it actually means to be at the edge of chaos?
+ What principles can we use in our lives, social systems and culture to reach the edge of chaos?
+ Development of Second Nature (re: PFC, default mode network, hierarchy) READ Bookchin
+ Proposal that second nature is also when a self emerges
+ Better grasp of emergent complexity, complex systems and the edge of chaos itself.
+ What principles should our social, cultural and economic systems follow to allow us to achieve this?
+ How do you tie together metamodernism, social ecology and regenerative cultures?
+ How does imaginal work relate to this?
+ How does the development of neoliberalism relate to this? 

Our aim for this article was tot ie together:
+ Social Ecology
+ Edge of Chaos
+ Fluid Mode
+ Meaning
+ Meta-modernism
+ Ways of Seeing
+ The Transjective Perspective
+ Developmental Stage Theories
+ Eros
+ Enlightenment
+ Will to Power / Joyous Affect

At the edge of chaos, complex dynamic systems are at their most creative (Kauffman, 1995).
