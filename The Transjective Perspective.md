# The Transjective Perspective
Modernism fixates on the objective. 

Postmodernism fixates on the subjective.

But actually life is a co-creation, an intra-action, between the objective and the subjective.

In whatever state we are in, whether transcendent or in the depths of depression, there is always a filter between us and the world.

The myth of modernity was that some more objective realm was accessible without a filter operating.

The myth of post-modernity was that the outside world didn’t matter: reality is all filter.

To investigate and begin to play with the relationship between self and the outside world is the transjective perspective.

Currently the only work in this area we have explored is Rob Burbea’s [Ways of Seeing][1]
