# Tools for Prefigurative Movements
How can social movement practice the prefigurative politics of an ecological society (that is, a society free from hierarchy and domination, harmonious with nature and embodying its principles of unity in diversity, complexity, mutualism, non-hierarchical relationships,  co-evolution, self-organisation)?

+ Regular people’s assemblies: embodying the direct democracy necessary to act sensibly on climate emergency, and empowering members to use this tool in their day-to-day community life.
+ Local community development
+ Every voice to be heard and valued; the developmental stage of each person respected. Every viewpoint is valid from the life circumstances of the individual.
+ Intra-organisational community development
+ Regenerative culture to be enacted in all and every meeting, interaction and communication, both internal to XR and with external parties. Events dedicated to regenerative culture.
+ Authentic relating, deep listening, emotional connection. Funding available for Joanna Macy’s “Work that Reconnects” workshops.
+ Commitment to personal development, embodied practice 
+ Co-evolution inspired personal development: growing together, by sharing and supporting one another’s journeys.
+ Practicing radical honesty, radical self-expression, radical self-reliance
+ Systematic exposition, processing and elimination of all forms of social domination, oppression, exploitation, hierarchy, manipulation, violence.
+ Commitment to experiment
+ Commitment to spontaneity and creativity
+ Commitment to arts, culture, dance, music, poetry and spoken word
+ Education about principles of natural processes and systems and how to embody these in human social relations
+ Creating temporary and permanent autonomous zones in which to organise, create, celebrate, commune 
+ Move toward economic self-sufficiency 
+ Exploring visions of social utopias and attempting to realise them in the here and now
+ Existential relating: sharing thoughts, emotions and narratives around life, death, spirituality, and climate emergency. Communally exploring what Jem Bendell calls “positive deep adaptation”.
+ Regenerative projects in the realms of energy, food, transport, economics…
