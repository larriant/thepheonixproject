German philosopher Heidegger contrasted between two primary modes of human existence: 

1) The “everyday” mode, in which we are concerned with *how* things are in the world; we are continually absorbed in the particulars and conditions of life, and derive meaning from the manipulating them, primarily in the ways our native culture has raised us to. For example, I might be heavily preoccupied with the clothes I wear, and find meaning in the identity that comes with dressing a certain way. In the everyday mode we are concerned with *forms* above all else. It correlates with modernism, as particular forms are taken to be absolute, eternal, and .

2) The “ontological” or “existential” mode, in which we are no longer concerned with the way things are but the fact that they *are* at all. That anything exists at all becomes our primary concern and fascination. While this mode can serve to liberate one from the tyranny of everyday mode’s trivial mind-games, it can also lead to nihilism: from a perspective of simply existing, nothing - no act, object, outcome, or intention - is different from anything else. Everything is equal and therefore meaningless, which is an attitude reflected in lots of existentialist literature, notably Sartre. The characteristic of this mode is a feeling of *emptiness*. It correlates with postmodern thought, where all forms are defabricated and deconstructed through social and cultural analysis.

An integration of Heidegger’s two modes might be the doorway to an “awakened life”, in which we are fully engaged with *both* the particulars of life *and* the existential dimension of it (the sheer fact of being). We might call it the “everyday existential” mode. This mode allows us to be totally active in changing reality for the benefit of all beings, and yet detached from the outcomes and results of our actions - free from the desires and aversions that are the hallmark of the everyday mode.

It allows us to engage in meaning-making as a creative, playful and exploratory adventure. Our way of seeing, our ontological perspective, actively transforms reality.

This is a metamodern mode of being: a synthesis of the modernist and postmodernist stages that preceded it.

This mode reflects the Zen Buddhist ideal of a total integration of daily life and meditation practice. It is echoed in the sutra “form is emptiness, and emptiness form”.
