James Lovelock, The Revenge of Gaia (2006): 

“In several ways we are unintentionally at war with Gaia (the living Earth), and to survive with our civilisation intact we urgently need to make a just peace with Gaia while we are strong enough to negotiate and not a defeated, broken rabble on our way to extinction. Can present-day democracies act fast enough for an effective defence?’

“I think we have little option but to prepare for the worst and assume that we have already passed the threshold.”

“We need the people of the world to sense the real and present danger so that they will spontaneously mobilise and unstintingly bring about an orderly and sustainable withdrawal to a world where we try to live in harmony with Gaia ” 

“I knew that our self-regulating Earth had evolved from those organisms that left a better environment for their progeny and by the elimination of those who fouled their habitat, but I never realised just how destructive we were, or that we had so grievously damaged the Earth that Gaia now threatens us with the ultimate punishment of extinction.”

“We are part of the Gaian family, and valued as such, but until we start acting as if human welfare was all that mattered, and was the excuse for our bad behaviour, all talk of further development of any kind is unacceptable.“

“There is a deep need in all of us for trust in something larger than ourselves, and I put my trust in Gaia…. Our task as individuals is to think of Gaia first. In no way does this make us inhuman or uncaring; our survival as a species is wholly dependent on Gaia and on our acceptance of her discipline.“

*When and where is the collapse?*

Climate and ecological collapse is not a future occurrence: this is it. There is no time other than now, so bring collapse home to where it belongs: in your moment-to-moment attitudes, decisions and behaviours. 

Collapse is when you choose food with packaging, drop litter, kill and eat animals, oppress people around you, cheat and betray, gossip, drive when you could cycle, act out of fear and selfishness, interrupt someone, order off Amazon, fly to Italy, and buy new clothes. 
Collapse is another day at the office. 
Collapse is business as usual. 
Collapse is standing by while the world burns. 
Collapse is inaction. 
Collapse is failure to believe in another way of life; failure to seek it out; failure to try.

Collapse isn’t “out there in the world” or “here in my mind”, but in the space between; the interaction of the two.
