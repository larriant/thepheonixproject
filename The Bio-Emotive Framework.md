# The Bio-Emotive Framework
Created by Douglas Tataryn

In Douglasâ€™ map emotions and feelings are two different things.

# Emotions
Emotions are felt in the body.
There are 4 emotions:
+ Fear
+ Anger
+ Sad
+ Happy

# Feelings 
Feelings he separates into two groups.

**Core Feelings** which we experience as part of who we are. 

And **Inter-Personal feelings** which are fleeting and happen in the moment.

Core feelings are your emotional brain's perception or best guess of your relational status with the people with whom you are interacting.

Unfortunately we also tend to carry several unresolved feelings (i.e., not fully experienced and expressed) around with us, biasing our feeling perceptions in that direction over and over.   

It will take some time and some work for you to determine how much is coming from the present situation you are processing and how much is coming from your unresolved emotional history.  

The 9 Core Feelings are:
+ Alone
+ Inadequate
+ Insignificant
+ Lost
+ Helpless
+ Worthless
+ Loss / Emptiness
+ Bad (person)
+ Hopeless

# Crying
Crying is a visual and auditory communication to our community, family, clan etc. that we need support.
