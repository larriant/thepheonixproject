# Environment

Modernity destroys the environment.

## Planetary Boundaries
Our planet has limits. Huge burdens are placed upon it by human activity.

Boundaries crossed are in bold.
1. **Climate Change**
2. **Biodiversity loss**
3. **Biogeochemical** (nitrogen removed from atmosphere / phosphorous in oceans)
4. Ocean acidification (saturation of aragonite in seawater)
5. Land use (surface area converted to crops)
6. Freshwater (global human consumption of water)
7. Ozone Depletion
8. Atmospheric Aerosols
9. Chemical Pollution 

## Data
* The population of wild animals on Earth has halved since 1970.
* Humans have provoked the worst spate of extinctions since the dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago.
* Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions.
