Modernity destroys the environment.

## Planetary Boundaries
Our planet has limits. Huge burdens are placed upon it by human activity.

Boundaries crossed are in bold.
1. **Climate Change**
2. **Biodiversity loss**
3. **Biogeochemical** (nitrogen removed from atmosphere / phosphorous in oceans)
4. Ocean acidification (saturation of aragonite in seawater)
5. Land use (surface area converted to crops)
6. Freshwater (global human consumption of water)
7. Ozone Depletion
8. Atmospheric Aerosols
9. Chemical Pollution
