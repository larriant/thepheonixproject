# Philosophical Terms
3 Parts of Metaphysics (what is there and what is it like?):
* Ontology: What exists?
* Epistemology: What is knowledge?
* Cosmology: What is the cosmos? (the whole)


Philosophical Realism: view that objects exist in reality independent of our conceptual scheme. (the world is mind independent)

Philosophical Relativism: knowledge is always historically, socially, and culturally situated.

Naturalism: idea that only natural as opposed to supernatural or spiritual laws and forces operate in the world.

Hermeneutics: the study of interpretation.

* Normative: making claims about what is right and wrong. 
* Positive: factual statements that attempt to describe reality. 

Linguistic Relativity (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis): the structure of a speaker’s language affects its speakers’ world-view or cognition.

# Ontology

Object-oriented ontology: rejects the human privileging of human existence over non-human objects

[Speculative Realism][1]: 

[Transcendental Materialism][2]:

[Solipsism][3]: only my own mind is sure to exist.

# Epistemology
Regress Problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified?

[Foundationalism][4]: certain "foundations" or "basic beliefs" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from other beliefs.

[Coherentism][5]: an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system

Rationalism: 

Empiricism:

Pragmatism: The truth is what is practically applicable in the world.

Analytic proposition: a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept; e.g., "All bachelors are unmarried," 

Synthetic proposition: a proposition whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept; e.g., "All bachelors are alone," or, "All bodies have weight."


# Free Will
Determinism: all events are ‘determined’ by previously existing courses.

Compatibilism: Free Will and Determinism are compatible. i.e. both can be true. 

# Religion
Ecumenical: aimed at achieving unity of the religion. Inter-denominational

Eschatology: the part of theology concerned with the ultimate destiny of humanity. The “end of the world”.

# Psychology
Constructivism: The idea that humans construct or create their own realities. 



The analytic – synthetic distinction: Analytic statements can be proven true by analyzing their terms (they are tautological), meanwhile synthetic statements cannot be proven true by analyzing their terms.

The necessary – contingent distinction: Necessary statements are necessarily true in all cases, meanwhile contingent statements depend on more information (they are conditional).

The a priori – a posteriori distinction: A priori statements do not rely upon direct experience (they are rationalized), meanwhile a posteriori statements do rely on direct experience (they are empirical).
