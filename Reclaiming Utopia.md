# Reclaiming Utopia
We need to reclaim utopia.

Utopia has a bad reputation partly because recent utopian projects for restructuring society have failed (communism etc) but also because people see utopia as an unrealistic fixed end goal - out of touch with reality. 

Instead we see it as a guiding star. Something we are always moving towards, that can inform our engagement and response to present reality.

We must realise that **utopia is relative**. From the viewpoint of our ancestors, our access to modern medicine and technology is heaven on earth. We should be able to stop and appreciate this. 

However, from another viewpoint our world is deeply dystopian in many ways. 

To reach towards higher relative utopias we must engage with this suffering in order to build a better world. 

For this we need to see utopia as a process: the activity of using our imaginations to explore and experiment with radically different possibilities for human life and society. This allows us to **reclaim utopia**. 

Having a vision of a better world can show us how to live in the here and now. This is **lived utopianism**: “living out some portion of a transformed future in the here and now”.

Utopia can also be a point of orientation, a guiding star. It can give us a narrative to frame our efforts in the world. It can also remind us that the future is open - by imagining a better world we see that it is possible. 

So utopia is not a product or blueprint, or a theory in a book. It should be a social movement, a dance at the [edge of chaos][1] where we are communally, creatively and democratically redesigning and experimenting with new worlds.

> “If you don’t have a dream, how can you have a dream come true?” - Ruth Levitas
 
## Prefiguration 
Prefiguration is an example of **lived utopianism**.

To restructure society we need social movements. **Prefiguration** is when these movements embody the utopia they are trying to build. We need to move from utopian idealism to utopian activism.

What the climate movement needs: prefiguration centred on an ecological society; a culture and economy in harmony with nature.

> “The ends we seek - societies moving toward ever-greater complexity, diversity and freedom, creating unity through diversity and mutualistic organisation, and highly self-conscious about their relationship with nature - *can only be brought about by social movements that reflect and embody those same principles.*” - Bookchin

We have a list of [tools for prefigurative movements][2].

## Collapse and Utopia
You might think that collapse (the possibility that our civilisation is heading towards human extinction) makes utopia irrelevant. 

We disagree.

Whether or not collapse is happening, we still need for reach for utopia in order to escape the barren reality of [The Monster Factory][3].

And if, as some claim, collapse **is** inevitable, then the best thing we can do is make our society more resilient, adaptable and democratic. And to do that we must build a society that is reaching for utopia.

But also, if we only have finite time left, why not spend our time together reaching towards beauty. Reaching towards the utopia of the beautiful end.

## Imagination

> “Utopian thinking today requires no apology. Rarely in history has it been so crucial to draw on the imagination in order to create radical new alternatives to virtually every aspect of daily life.” - Bookchin

In order to reach for utopias: we must begin to imagine again. We must connect with the more beautiful world that our hearts know is possible.

We live in an **imagination desert**. Our imaginations have been silenced by [Capitalist Realism][4]: that alternatives to our present systems are not just unrealistic but unthinkable. 

Our education systems repress imagination and creativity. From an early age, we are schooled in a worldview that values facts over fantasies. The term dreamer is used as a dismissive put-down. Remember how much you used to draw, song and write poems as a child - what happened?

Imagination can allow us to see beyond the given order. We live in a world that is the product of other people’s imaginations that came before us. If we remember this, we’ll remember our power to create a new world…

To change something, we need to first hold in our mind and heart the possibility that it could be different. We can use imagination to uncover the potentials of the world that have not yet come into being… to explore radical new utopias.

> “Begin with the end in mind is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and physical or second creation to all things.”

The fantasy writer China Mièville says: “We should utopia as hard as we can. Along with a fulfilled humanity we should imagine flying islands, self-constituting coraline neighbourhoods, photosynthesising cars bred from biospliced bone-marrow. Big Rock Candy Mountains. Because we’ll never mistake those dreams for blueprints’. I sincerely hope that eco-critics (and others) might go forth as climate change utopians, keeping alive the possibility of innumerably various alternative futures and demanding the impossible.”
