# Deep ecology
Deep Ecology is an ecological philosophy developed by Arne Naess.

The Deep Ecology platform states: 
+ The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on earth have value in themselves... These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
+ Richness and diversity of life-forms contribute to the realisation of these values and are also values in themselves.
+ Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs…
+ The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher (materialistic) standard of living.
