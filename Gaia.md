*What is Gaia?*

Gaia is climate scientist James Lovelock’s name for the system that encompasses both the organic biosphere and Earth’s inorganic environment (atmosphere, water, soil, rock, sunlight, and so on). Through their coupling, this system seems to have the “goal” of *regulating itself* such that its conditions are optimal for the flourishing of organic life. This perspective goes further than seeing ecosystems are separate from their inorganic environment, and amazingly, has discovered that they actually manipulate that environment to further their health and stability.

For example, plants regulate the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at levels optimal for their fluorishing.

Over millions of years, the Sun is gradually become hotter by 0.5 celsius, and Lovelock posits that the recent series of ice ages have been attempts by Gaia to decrease global temperatures towards optimal conditions for plant life. 

- better examples?

In sum, the biophysical system we call Gaia continually strives to keep the Earth habitable. Through a disrespect of the coupling between ecosystems and their environment, we have polluted the latter to an extent that Gaia can no longer self-regulate, and as a result, is collapsing. 

*Bringing Gaia home*

James Lovelock writes: “let us go further now and try to sense Gaia by looking at the Earth from the outside as a whole planet”.

While this is a valuable exercise, we venture that there is a much more valuable way to approach Gaia. Let us go further now and try to sense Gaia by looking at the Earth from the inside out, as embodied beings who have emerged a vast and ancient biophysical network. We can feel ourselves as conscious manifestations of Gaia: the living Earth seeing and sensing itself.

Why is this valuable? It brings Gaia, and her collapse, into our personal experience. When we act with the same goal as Gaia - to sustain all life - we manifest as Gaia, or at least as an essential part of her inner workings. This is why action in service of all life, for example through climate activism, is a transformative experience: we become empowered with a perspective of deep, even total, intra-connection with the living Earth. In turn this allows us to open to its destruction, moving us to act selflessly in order to save it.

“What we most need to do is to hear within us the sound of the Earth crying” - Thich Naht Hanh

In sum, Gaia is not “out there”, and as long as we believe that she is, we will exploit and destroy her. Gaia exists as the consciousness of her countless organisms, including humans.  

The living Earth lives through us. Indeed, it *is* us. This insight allows us bring Gaia, and her quest to sustain all life, home, into our lived experience. Our life becomes the joyous and creative activity of maintaining Earth as a paradise for life - a vital movement in the great evolutionary dance towards complexity and beauty. Nothing is more effective at liberating our minds from the dream of separation and isolation that drive the currently imploding world-system of destruction and exploitation. 

We must reconnect with nature and see that we are totally inseparable from it. To re-wild the world, we must first re-wild ourselves.
