# Bohemian Dialogue

Dialogue is a way of observing, collectively, how hidden values and intentions can control our behaviour, and how unnoticed cultural differences can clash without our realising what is occurring.

## Problem
David Bohm suggested that a pervasive incoherence in the process of human thought is the essential cause of the endless crises affecting mankind.

## History
Some notion of the significance of such a Dialogue can be found in reports of hunter-gatherer bands of about this size, who, when they met to talk together, had no apparent agenda nor any predetermined purpose.

Such gatherings seemed to provide and reinforce a kind of cohesive bond or fellowship that allowed its participants to know what was required of them without the need for instruction or much further verbal interchange.


## Purpose and Meaning
People do not meet to dialogue to accomplish a task or be entertained. Only because of an interest in the unfoldment and revelation of the deeper collective meanings that may be revealed.

In an assembly of between twenty and forty people, extremes of frustration, anger, conflict and other difficulties may occur. These can become the central focus of the exploration in what might be understood as a kind of ‘meta-dialogue’.

There is no imposed consensus, nor is there any attempt to avoid conflict.

No single individual or sub-group is able to achieve dominance because every single subject, including domination and submission, is always available to be considered.

## How to start a dialogue
**Suspension** of thoughts, impulses, judgements, etc lies at the very heart of Dialogue.

Suspension involves exposing your reactions, impulses, feelings and opinions in such a way that they can be seen and felt within your own psyche and also be reflected back by others in the group.

If you are able to give attention to, say, the strong feelings that might accompany the expression of a particular though - either your own or another’s - and to sustain that attention, the activity of the thought process will tend to slow you down.

This may permit you to begin to see the deeper meanings underlying your though process and to sense the often incoherent structure of any action that you might otherwise carry out automatically.

**Numbers**: A dialogue works best with between twenty and forty people seated facing each other in a single circle. A group of this size allows for the emergence and observation of different subgroups or subcultures than can help to reveal some of the ways in which though operates collectively.

**Leadership**: A dialogue is essentially a conversation between equals. Any controlling authority, no matter how carefully or sensitively applied, will tend to hinder and inhibit the free play of thought and often delicate and subtle feelings that would otherwise be shared.

The role of the facilitator should be to point out situations that might seem to be presenting sticking points for the group, in other words, to aid the process of collective proprioception, but these interventions should never be manipulative not obtrusive. 

**Subject Matter**: The dialogue can begin with any topic of interest to the participants. If some members of the group feel that certain exchanges or subjects are disturbing or not fitting, it is important that they express these thoughts within the Dialogue.
