# Guerrilla Metaphysics

We live in a ‘Metaphysical Monoculture’ where one set of metaphysics has come to rule the nest and all other possibilities are off the table.

There are 3 main areas of metaphysics:
+ Ontology: What exists?
+ Epistemology: What is knowledge?
+ Cosmology: What is the cosmos? (the whole)

New types of metaphysics might allow us to confront today’s crises.

The idea of Guerrilla Metaphysics is that we should start experimenting with new forms of metaphysics.
