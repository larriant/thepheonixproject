# Guerrilla Metaphysics

We live in a ‘Metaphysical Monoculture’ where one set of metaphysics has come to rule the nest and all other possibilities are off the table.

There are 3 main areas of metaphysics:
+ Ontology: What exists?
+ Epistemology: What is knowledge?
+ Cosmology: What is the cosmos? (the whole)

**An Example of Ontological Monoculture**
For example we live in a world where what exists is the individual and their desires.  Looking through the lens of the individual is not the only way to see the world. We could also look at the world through the lens of the dividual, the group or society as a whole. 

**An Example of Epistemological Monoculture**
Our society season reason as the only valid way of knowing. But actually there are alternative epistemological basis such as intuition which our society denigrates.

**An Example of Cosmological Monoculture**
Our society explains the big picture of the cosmos through selfish genes with no directionality. An equally valid way to look at things is Zak Stein’s Eros i.e. that the universe seems to be tending towards higher and higher concentrations of complexity largely through a process of co-operation.

New types of metaphysics might allow us to confront today’s crises.

The idea of **Guerrilla Metaphysics** is that we should start experimenting with new forms of metaphysics.
