# Concentric Circles of Self

There are many different [ways of seeing][1] the self. 

Our society is limited to the **separate self** or individual. This is a discrete entity separate from other people and the world.

Another way of seeing is the **connected self**. This recognises that we are part of many larger circles. Our communities, our society, the ecological world and the universe itself.

We can practice looking at the world through these different perspectives.

The **dividual** is a way of seeing that highlights the relationship between two individuals. Two friends are not individuals but are constantly co-creating each other. When together they amount to more than the sum of their individual selves.

Arne Naess introduced the term **ecological self** to describe the wider sense of identity that arises when our self-interest includes the natural world.

This perspective can also be used to look for ways of seeing smaller than the individual. That the individual is made up of many **sub-minds**, often out of conscious control. 

Experiencing a wider identity of self does not mean losing our individuality. Instead, it is through finding and playing our unique role within a community that we feel more strongly part of it. 

For a complex system to self-organise and function well, it requires both the integration and the differentiation of its parts.
