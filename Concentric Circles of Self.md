# Concentric Circles of Self

There are many different [ways of seeing][1] the self. 

Our society is limited to the **separate self** or individual. This is a discrete entity separate from other people and the world.

Another way of seeing is the **connected self**. This recognises that we are part of many larger circles. Our communities, our society, the ecological world and the universe itself.

Arne Naess introduced the term **ecological self** to describe the wider sense of identity that arises when our self-interest includes the natural world.

Experiencing a wider identity of self does not mean losing our individuality. Instead, it is through finding and playing our unique role within a community that we feel more strongly part of it. 

For a complex system to self-organise and function well, it requires both the integration and the differentiation of its parts.
