… altruism cascades! Some highlights:

“We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members’ contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence.”

“In the particular case of cooperation or altruistic behavior, it is well known that one person’s altruism toward another can elicit reciprocal altruism in repeated paired interactions (direct reciprocity) (30) and also in groups (31, 32). Indeed, many individuals are “conditional cooperators” who give more if others give more and who are influenced in their interactions with others by what the others are doing during the interaction (33, 34). It also is well known that reputation mechanisms that provide information about a person’s past behavior can help sustain cooperation (indirect reciprocity) (35).”

“This multiplier effect also suggests that behavioral imitation and interpersonal spread may be an important factor in the evolution of cooperation in humans. For example, cascades of cooperative (or non-cooperative) behavior can promote coordination on a particular strategy, possibly decreasing within-group variance.”

“Cascades also may help mitigate the negative effect of group size on cooperation (11, 42) because they reduce the number of independent entities in a population, effectively increasing the size of groups in which public goods can be maintained via self-interest. ”

“(i) behavior can spread from person to person to person to person via a diverse set of mechanisms, subject to certain constraints, and (ii) as a result, each person in a network can influence dozens or even hundreds of people, some of whom he or she does not know and has not met.”
