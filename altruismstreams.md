# Altruism Streams

Thought exercise: **Altruism Streams**. 

What are the different ways we can help people, and to help them help others?
* **Anarchism, community, autonomy**: helping others organise non-hierarchically, autonomously, democratically, without centralised and coercive authorities. Helping them work, live and share as communities.
* **Giving and sharing**: helping people to better follow their altruistic motivations and to identify ways they can help others
* **Psychology**: helping others attain happiness and peace of mind, and to realise their innate capacity for limitless altruism. Liberation from maladaptive thought patterns such as materialism/consumerism, patriarchy, power structures, competition… (what else?). Meditation, psychedelics, yoga, Wim Hof, neurohacking, journaling, etc. as key things to share in this stream.
* **Creativity**: helping others know the joys of creating - particularly in group/interactive/participatory contexts. (Burning man as example)
* **Rationality**: giving people the invaluable tools of the scientific method and evidence-based reasoning.
Financial and material. Self-explanatory. The current focus of modern philanthropy / charity.
* **Environmental**? Help people benefit the environment more, be more sustainable and self-sufficient
… ?
Also **political engagement** can be an important way to make change happen and help people.
Note: Burning man events help people in all 5 of anarchism, giving, psychology, environmental and creativity streams!
