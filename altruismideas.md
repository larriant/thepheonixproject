# Altruism Ideas

Random ideas we've had over the months that it seemed important to capture:

* Give a few public talks / presentations on altruism/our ideas
* Run an altruism workshop - discussion group - day course
* Make an altruism mini-documentary
* Website and facebook group/page - starting a digitally connected altruism community
* “Let’s make Utrecht amazing” event
* Burn / anarchist day/evening event, e.g. a really really free market
* Start to build a wiki of resources for aspiring altruists.
* ….?

Other ideas:
* Crowdfund a small project: just to get an idea of how it works and the potential behind it. This experience could be very valuable later on. 
* Unlocking Creativity event with psilocybin truffles
* Organise a metta meditation class, perhaps find a senior meditator to teach this
* Combining metta meditation with MDMA ?
* Meetup: existential cafe open discussion group
* Modern Altruism HowTo ebook (contains everything in this document, basically) 
* Art Installation Idea: some way of putting all our collected altruism quotes (see bottom of doc) into a public space, to inspire people. We could also add a rotating quote feature to our website / wiki. 
* Altruism Hackathon. Helpathon? Gather a load of people and go into teams to make cool social enterprise type things.
* …?

Later down the road:
* Altruism day/weekend course
* Altruism Conference
* Altruism Center
* Place where people can go to find their purpose. / Altruism Retreats

Funding it All
* Public donations: patreon, crowdfunding
* Giving altruism courses and asking for a reasonable fee OR an optional donation
* Altruism coaching service. Help others find meaning and fulfillment in altruistic causes. Almost like altruism therapy!
* Finding a product or service to sell… 
* Some form of social enterprise (like an altruism coffee shop where we employ homeless people). Could be a good way of learning a lot of things that we can then spread to the world through coaching etc.
* … ? 


Altruism Day:
* Begin with metta meditation / yoga / other practices.
* Then have a talk from Jules + Will about our altruism NGO / why altruism is important? Basically give our altruism manifesto in talk form
Then either:
* A day of brainstorming building projects in local (Utrecht?) community;
* A day of personal and communal discovery of what we can uniquely contribute.
* Find existing projects and go help them! We should look to collaborate with others as much as possible.
* End with socialising (cannabis, beers?) and group flow activities like IGO + Group Art + Group Improv.
