# Coming from Gratitude

How can we respond to [collapse][1] in a way that will empower us to do what we can for the planet? 

It needs to avoid acceptance or denial of collapse and allow us to work towards [game change][2].

We believe the gratitude [way of seeing][3] can achieve this.

Advantages of Gratitude:
+ Gratitude for the gift of life, which is the originating impulse of all spiritual traditions, can inspire us to do everything we can to protect life on Earth.
+ In these times of collapse, turmoil and danger, gratitude can help to steady and ground us.
+ Even though our world is in crisis, this in no way diminishes the wonder of this present moment. Gratitude is not dependent on our external circumstances.
+ Gratitude is also helps fight again the consumerism upon which capitalism depends. If we are satisfied we no longer need to consume.
