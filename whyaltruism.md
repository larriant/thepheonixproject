# Why spreading Altruism is Important?

Thought: the world’s biggest problem is that most people are dismissing and ignoring the world’s biggest problems! This tendency usually occurs from a place of self-preoccupation - ultimately a lack of consideration for other people, animals and the environment. Most people are concerned with their problems only, and so we have a global culture of competition. The mindset of altruism is important because it can change the way that people act towards our shared problems, as well as those smaller of other individuals. If everybody began to actively realise their capacity for unconditional friendliness and benevolence, altruistic actions and thus cooperation towards solving the world’s problems would ensue naturally and rapidly. In this way we can catalyse a shift to a global culture of cooperation and compassion.

Above making altruists, there is the notion of unlocking altruists! Think how many people - particularly the young - are desperate to help and contribute, but lack the value-system for doing so (altruism) as well as the concrete opportunities to do so. These individuals need an educational organisation that will guide them towards why and how to live a life of altruism.
