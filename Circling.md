# Circling
Circling is a group conversation practice that usually lasts an hour to an hour and a half, and involves 3 to 9 people.

Circling is, first and foremost, a practice of un-withheld present moment connection to self and others. It is the attempt to understand what it’s like to be in another person’s skin, while simultaneously being true to ourselves.

An alternative formulation is that Circling is about discovering “truth”, or about bringing more self-awareness and discernment into the experience of life, in order to cultivate connection with oneself and others.

Anything you say or do in a circling group ought to pass the test: **is this intervention serving connection?**

We frequently make mistakes in judgement about whether a particular intervention and self-expression (or else a failure to express) is serving truth or connection.

Am I in this moment service truth and connection, or am I doing the opposite? (hiding, lying and creating distance)

**Circling exposes the meta-conversation**

There are two common types of circles:
+ **Birthday circles** in which one individual is the primary focus of attention for the entire group.
+ **Organic circles** in which the attention flows back and forth between all participants.

The practice of **Guerrilla circling** is to interact with people with the assumption that they want to belong, to be valued and cared of, and to be acknowledged for their contributions. 

## Circling Best Practices
**Notice Feelings and Body Sensations**

People have a greater or lesser skills, or ability, to accurately feel into and discern the true nature of their current emotional experience.

Almost all of us have trouble distinguishing our deepest and truest emotions in the midst of all the “noise”. And distinguishing them from the needs, and demands of others. And articulating those feelings in the midst, perhaps of our fear and anxiety that we will not be received, or worse, that people will be angry and reject us, even as we attempt to express our deepest truths and most tender secrets.

Ask questions like:
+ What are you feeling right now?
+ How did that land?
+ What is going on for you right now?

**Connect with the group - up to a point (follow your aliveness)**
Once you start noticing your responses to the circle, and have made your best commitment to “presence” (however you interpret this word, but think non-attachment, non-reactivity, non-doing). 

You will be faced with choices of whether to communicate your feelings and how to do it.

Your attitude to these thoughts, feelings and sensations would be to “welcome everything”.

Connect or align with the group as mush as possible, but without betraying yourself. In other words, follow your aliveness.

Trust your experience.

**Get their world: lead from attention, curiosity and empathy**
Ultimately, everyone wants to be seen, understood and accepted for their unique qualities and gifts. The more we do this, the more likely it is that other people will reciprocate.

Curiosity is a desire to know someone, and is the first step of empathy, the attempt to accurately mirror back to someone their felt experience.

The primary tool of empathy is called **reflection**. Simply repeat what you heard the person say, maybe even in their exact words.

For instance: “What I hear you saying is… Am I getting it right?”

But if you are not getting what they are saying: “… but I am not sure I am fully getting you”.

“You seem upset right now (or angry, or irritated, or anxious, or peaceful, or soft)… Is that true? If so, can you cay more about that?”

Another frequently-used aspect of empathy is called **validation**. The attempt to articulate their felt experience in a way that lets know that you understand why they are feeling this way and you approve of them as such.

“That makes sense to me because….”

**Validate and Appreciate**
Most of us resist telling people that we find them interesting and attractive, or their ways of being that we find loveable, courageous or intriguing.

Is is essential to kill our internal messages that telling people how much we like them is inappropriate.

**Lead from Vulnerability**
As well as trying to elicit and understand another person’s felt experience, you will also want to reveal your own felt experience.

Sharing your true feelings, and especially those feeling which you are most afraid to reveal, angry, ashamed or guilty about.

Why is sharing vulnerability such a powerful practice for creating connection?

First because it is such a courageous act of love. People usually want to know us.

Secondly, people often see it as permission to share more of themselves as well.

It is quite important to examine your own motives prior to sharing negative feelings with another person. To the extent there is any sense of “make-wrong” towards the other person, and that you are speaking to them out of a demand that they change their behaviour in order to please you or ease your own suffering, or out of a desire to teach them something such as the “correct” way to behave, you need to go back to the drawing board and find a different attitude.

This is especially true when you feel a sense of rightness, or even “righteous indignation” about their behaviour.

**Sharing Impact, Offer reflection and inquiry**
**Sharing Impact** is another aspect of vulnerability. It means to let people know how they occur to you, and particularly and emotional reactions you may be having to them: joy, excitement, sadness, anxiety, tension in your body, irritation, boredom, confusion, or whatever.

Most people want to know and are intensely curious about how they occur to others.

To **Offer Reflection and Inquiry** is to ask a question that deepens a person’s process, an offer to further distinguish or articulate their felt experience.

**Own Your Experience**
**Owning your experience** means to frame your communications more in terms of your feelings, needs and desires in relationship to another person, and less in terms of your beliefs or judgements about the person, the reasons that you think this person is the way they are, or the things they are saying which you think are wrong.

Rather than “Kind people do not talk like this”.
“I get really irritated with you when you leave dirty dishes and then I feel disconnected from you”.

Try to make an unarguable statement: a statement that nobody can disagree with because it references your own feelings, for which you are the undisputed authority.

**Make Right, Not Wrong**
People are the way they are for a reason, they are the product of their genes, and of the environment that nurtured them (or not).

People change a lot faster in the direction that you want (or that they want for themselves), when they are first accepted as they are.

You will attempt to find **something** to agree with, empathise or appreciate about them.

**Be Impactful**
The idea there is when people share something sensitive about themselves, they are usually not interested so much in your thoughts or judgements about their experience, whether you think they are right or wrong to be feeling and thinking as they are.

But they are, usually, very interested in your ability to get their experience and to be moved by it.

**Honour Yourself**
Means to take care of yourself emotionally in your interactions with people.

Specifically it means that you do not have to do anything that doesn’t feel right to you, answer any question, accept anybody’s feedback, or be any particular way, regardless of what anyone says.

**Welcome Everything**
It is better to welcome what is already present rather than to resist it.

Means to accept whatever thoughts and feelings are arising in the moment, as perhaps, something valuable, something which carries the potential for insight or an interesting and transformative conversation.

Everything that is happening inside of you in relation to the group is “an excuse for intimacy”. Meaning that you are in a process of self-discover and other-discovery in a way that is quite mysterious and that all of your feelings, no matter how unrelated they may seem, are contributing to that.

**Slow Down**
Often the first thing that needs to happen to deepen a group conversation is simply to start taking our time.

We can choose to appreciate the unfolding mystery of connection as it’s happening.

**Surrender Gracefully**
The personal meaning of “surrender” is to accept the fact that we a certain way and feel certain things, and to stop fighting with ourselves about that.

In relation to other people: stop trying to change people or argue with them, and accept them as they are. You may even simply decide to do what they want you to do, for their sake, even though it may not be something you need or want for yourself.

## Circling Perspectives and Advanced Practices
**The Yin and Yang of Circling**
There exists a tension between being non-judgemental open and accepting to what is arising and being invested or attached to certain outcomes.

Yin: noting what’s present, opening up to and feeling and embracing another’s experience.

Yang: naming what is missing, drilling in, stepping outside of patterns, enlarging perspectives.

“I get you and I am here for you” (Yin), versus “Here is what you are missing and how it could be better” (Yang). 

The fundamental rule in circling is that: **Yin trumps Yang**.

**Topical Circling**
We hold the container more loosely. Advice and coaching are permissible. Provided they are wanted. A mix between regular circling and a mastermind group which is a popular group structure.

## Complementary Modalities
**NVC**
In NVC, any expression of need is considered a gift, as it gives another person an opportunity to contribute to you and hence make like more wonderful for both of you.

**Self-Circling**
Involved simply reflecting on what’s happening as if there was someone in connection with me helping me to explore and probe it.

Like, I might notice I feel angry. “Where is this anger? How does it feel? Is it moving?”

It relies on the commitment to connection with myself: being willing to stay with feelings that I’d normally want to push away or distract myself from or project onto others, to accept them, to listen to them, let them be seen and experienced fully.

**Internal Family Systems (IFS)**
IFS posits that our psyches are composed of multiple “sub-personalities” who are often at war with each other, engaging in continuous conflict which lessens our effectiveness by filling our heads with arguments that never get resolved, and taking attention away from creative and constructive solutions and actions.

The solution to this problem is to “circle” your sub-personalities.

You can journal in each of the sub-personalities voices.

It can be quite helpful to give sub-personalities names. 

The first week I did this was quite exhilarating because every day a new sub-personality would emerge and get named.


**Inner Relationship Focusing**
A technique for accessing and gaining discernment into felt-experience and for there clearing emotional conflicts. Comes from Gendlin’s Focusing.

**Withholds, Victor Baranco style**
The goal of a withhold is to share a thought or an emotion, positive or negative, in a way that expressly and by agreement of both sides is not taking ownership of the feeling or experience and hence carries an explicit request to not take it too seriously.

When I say something like “I think you are lazy”, I am explicitly declaring that what I am about to say may have no bearing on the truth, and may not even by my own full experience, just a part of it.

“I have a withhold, will you hear it?”
“You are lazy”
“Thank you”

**Somatic Experiencing and Hakomi**
Both share the belief that trauma experiences that occur either in childhood or as adults lodge in the body, and so long as they remain unconscious, will affect our behaviour and create all kinds of problems with our health, life-coping strategies and relationships.

Read The Body Keeps the Score.

**Adult Attachment Theory**
The early experiences between parent and child create working models of relationships that, without reflection, an adult will carry with them for their entire lives.

Basically, an adult with insecure attachment will frequently either not clearly recognise their own needs, or the other person’s, or both.”

By contrast, “securely attached adults have a greater capacity to trust others, tolerate conflict, and exercise discernment when forming new bonds.

**The Evolutionary Relationships Movement**
We have outgrown individual methods of spiritual growth, including meditation, individual therapy, or body/mind practices such as yoga and are being called to something else, a type of “mutual awakening”.

**Sociocracy**
Sociocracy is a whole-systems approach to designing and leading organisations.

Sociocracy requires that individuals understand and practice we-space principles in order for it to be effective.

## Leader Formats
### A/R Game Format
**Introductions**
Start with an introduction round of (1) name (2) why you are here (3) something unique or unusual about you

**Context Setting**
+ A/R is the invitation to bring more of ourselves into interaction with people, to stop cloaking our humanity or pretending to be something different than who we really are.
+ Tell them we are going to play some communication games but that it is very important they they don’t do anything they don’t want to do, or feel any pressure to show up any way other than they are currently feeling. They can sit out any game and if they have an objection to anything that’s going on, they should voice it.
+ Give some history. Explaining that A/R movement started in California in 1999. A/R Movement has two primary categories: A/R Games and Circling.
+ Finally I do short “popcorn-style” impacts on my context-setting.

**Warm Up**
Plan 15-20 minutes for the warm-up and warm-up impact round (debrief).

Helps to “drop” people into connection immediately and enter a place of presence from which the actual circle will be way more powerful. 

+ Set them up in pairs.
+ Do one round of “best friends”. Pick a person to begin. Then you are going to explain to this person what they would need to know about you to be your best friend. Who you are, what you value and enjoy, what you hate and all your personality flaws that your best friend would need to know and accept about you.
+ One round of Noticing Game. To get more relational and more present-moment. First person says: “I notice (bla)”. You could notice something about their physical experience, an emotional reaction you are having to them, or something completely unrelated to them, like your wife is leaving you and you just lost your job and so you are feeling distracted. Second person says: “On hearing that, I notice (bla)” And so forth. 
+ Then switch partners and do a second round of noticing game. If the group is strong I change the final noticing game to eye-gazing. 

**The Game**
+ I give everyone a hot-seat and an appreciation/ impact round.
+ In a group of 8 in a 2 hour meeting. Each person would get roughly a 7 minute hot-seat and a 3 minute impact / appreciation round.
+ How to explain hot seat: They are going to get all of the attention in the room for X minutes. People will be invited to ask them questions which they can answer, or not, as they please. Indeed during their hot-seat they are going to be the undisputed King of Queen of the evening.
+ How to explain questioner role: They can ask any questions that they have genuine curiosity about, even questions that might seem risqué. They should not shut-down or dampen their genuine curiosity, because the person on the hot-seat does not have to answer if they don’t want to. I also tell them that they should say “Thank you’ when the person finished talking OR when they have heard enough.

**Checkout round**
“How are you feeling and what are you taking home from this?”

### Circling Introduction Leader Format
You can do the same introduction given in the A/R Game format.

**Context Setting**
+ Circling is the invitation to bring more of ourselves into interaction with people, to stop cloaking our humanity or pretending to be something different than who we really are.
+ Circling is about being present to what is. Especially in the space between us.

You can use the same warm-up as for the A/R game above.

**The Circle**
Decide in advance how many people will get mini-birthday circles and announce. A birthday circle is where one person gets all the attention of the group for a certain amount of time. 

Time the birthday circle. You can hold up fingers to indicate how many minutes left (3,2,1). 

Time the impact / appreciation round. It’s an opportunity to either say something you appreciate about someone, or else a way in which they have affected you, in case you have a felt experience of reaction to them.

## Giving Feedback
When we can’t share what’s wrong, such as a distressing experience we are having in relation to a person or an organisation, small annoyances become deep resentments and we stifle energy that could be put towards creating productive collaborations.

Adopt a culture where giving and receiving feedback is a regular and non-threatening part of day-to-day life.

Tips for giving feedback:
1. Check in with yourself: is this the right time? 
2. Ask if the other person is open to receiving feedback and if it’s a good time?
3. Be aware of your intentions in giving the feedback.
4. Share your experience, and especially your felt-experience. 
5. Be curious about the other person, how you might be impacting them and what they might be thinking.
6. Be clear about what you want to happen, or not happen, in the future.

Avoid:
+ Name calling or labelling
+ Assigning motives to the other person
+ Remember that the point of the feedback is to affect your future with this person in a positive way.


Tips for receiving feedback:
1. Check in with yourself: how is you’re listening?
2. Reflect back what you heard. 
3. Ask questions.
4. Thank the speaker for being willing to give you the feedback.
5. Avoid instant judgements of whether the other person is right or wrong.

Remember:
+ Feedback that feels “wrong” to you may contain a kernel of truth. Feedback that sounds “right” to you may be only their projection.
+ Negative feedback to you doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with you.
