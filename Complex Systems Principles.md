**Optimal Connectivity**  

A principle from systems theory that can inform our design of systems - from brains and communities through to nations and ecosystems.

It is the “observation that, in many complex systems, both optimal functionality and maximum structural complexity are obtained when system components are, on average, connected neither too densely or too sparsely. (Goertzel) “when the connectivity is too small, or too large, the system’s functioning in its environment is relatively unintelligent. Each component or node should be connected to only a moderate number of other components. Too many connections and the systems dynamics will become so complicated as to be unmanageable, or else may fall into some simple repetitive global pattern.”

This informs our pursuit of the edge of chaos as we learn that:

•	Chaotic systems have richly connected components, so each state of the system can lead to a whole host of other states.  

•	With only sparse connections between components, a system is slower at transitioning to any given state.  

•	There is an optimal connectivity, which is rich enough for the system to transition rapidly to a given state, but not so much that the behaviour becomes unpredictable. Such a system straddles the edge of chaos because it is finds an optimal trade-off between adaptivity and stability; between flexibility and resilience.  

Note that the optimal connectivity depends on what is considered optimal for the system, which depends on its environment.

**MetaSystem Dynamics

Principle (Goertzel): the most intelligent systems are those in which it is a pattern that the major subsystems cause each other to act more intelligently.Â 

This echoes natural ecosystems’ tendency of co-evolution. We might find such a principle at work in the dividual and communities we participate in; think of the couple who “bring out the best in one another”. 

**Structure-dynamics principle**

In many cases, specific components of a system are able to place the entire system in well defined states. They are pivot components.
