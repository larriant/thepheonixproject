**Know your enemy: Hierarchy **

So long as human social systems embody dominance hierarchies, we will continue to exploit and destroy the natural ecosystems that sustain and support us. This is a core premise of Bookchinâ€™s social ecology. But what is hierarchy?Â 

Specifically, we want to identify and eliminate all dominance hierarchies. These occur when a natural power imbalance (say, that Jo is physically stronger than Mo) is used to facilitate exploitation (Jo pushes Mo against the wall and takes his lunch money).Â 

Hanzi Freinacht tells us that all â€œdominator hierarchies disguise themselves as the â€œtriple-Nâ€ of all hidden oppression: Natural, Normal, Necessary.â€

Dominance hierarchies do not exist in natural ecosystems, and it is their pervaviseness in modern human society that is driving the ecological crisis.Â 

Neoliberal capitalism provides a way to systematise dominance hierarchies par excellence.

Some of the core dominance hierarchies that prop up global capitalism, which we must work to eliminate as a matter of urgency, are:

•	Neo-colonialism (for example the Maangamizi, or â€œAfrican hellacaustâ€)  

•	Racism. Embedded in both state governance (e.g. police oppression) and cultural prejudices   

•	Patriarchy and gender inequality; sexism, homophobia, transphobiaÂ   

•	Classism  

•	Debt  

•	The biological holocaust: both the destruction of natural ecosystems and systematic exploitation, murder of sentient animals  

•	Dominance hierarchies based on Psychological development stages (see the Listening Society). Examples might be the dominance of intelligent individuals over those who less intelligent, spiritually practiced over those who are not.Â   

•	Age-ism  

•	...
