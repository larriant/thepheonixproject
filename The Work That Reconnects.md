# The Work That Reconnects
Here is our repository of The Work that Reconnects exercises.

The spiral of the work that reconnects is divided into 4 sections:
1. Coming from Gratitude
2. Honouring Our Pain For the World
3. Seeing with New Eyes
4. Going Forth

## Coming From Gratitude
For context check out our page on: [Coming From Gratitude][1].
### Opening Through Breath
Begin by having everyone pay attention to their breathing for a few moments. as we let ourselves experience our pain for the world, the breath continues to serve us, much as it serves a woman in childbirth. It helps us relax and open to the flow of information, and to the changes it may bring.

### Opening Through the Body
Our faithful “Brother Ass” as St. Francis called the human body, is our most basic connection to our planet and our future.

To bring attention to the body, continue the guidance you began with the breath, using your own words to suggest something like the following:
> Stretch. Stretch all muscles, then release. Slowly rotate the head, easing the neck with all its nerve centres. Rotate the shoulders, releasing the burdens and tensions they carry. Behold your hand, feel the skin. Feel the textures of the world around you, clothing, arm of chair, tabletop, floor. Your senses are real; they connect you with your world; you can trust them.

### Opening Through Sound
To open up and tune in, we also turn to sound. So can sounding â€” letting the air flow through us in open vowels, letting our voices interweave in ah’s and oh’s, in Om’s and Shalom’s.
Sounding together we feel our capacity for community vibrate within and among us.

### Opening Through Silence
Together in stillness we attune to inner and deeper knowing. Sounding helps us to release the planetary anguish; silence helps us to listen to it. Some guides like to begin every session with a period of silence, eyes closed, just to settle in.

### Introductions with Gratitude
Invite people to share briefly:
1. Their name and where they are from
2. One thing they want us to know about them
3. One thing they love about being alive in Earth (of the many things they love, choose just one)

### Open Sentences on Gratitude
One is Partner A, the other Partner B - this can be determined quickly by asking them to tap each other on the knee; the one who tapped first is A. When guide speaks each unfinished sentence, A repeats it, completes it in his own words, addressing Partner B, and keeps on talking spontaneously for the time allotted.

For the completion of each open sentence allow a couple of minutes or so.

1. Some things I love about being alive in Earth are…
2. A place that was magical (or wonderful) to me as a child was…
3. A person who helped me believe in myself is or was…
4. Some things I enjoy doing and making are…
5. Some things I appreciate about myself are…

### Gratitude Rounds
Sitting in circles of five or six, people imagine they are at a point outside of space and time. After a short spell of silence, they start remembering together what they loved about living on Earth. That’s the first Round, which can circle more than once, and last for ten to fifteen minutes. The second Round focuses on what they liked about the humans of planet Earth. And in the Third Round, they reflect on what they were grateful for in being themselves.

### Mirror Walk
An outdoor setting. Forming pairs, people take turns being guided with eyes closed, in silence. Their partners, guiding them by the hand or arm, offer them various sensory experiences - a flower or leaf to smell, the texture of grass or tree trunk, the sound of birds or children playing -  all the while without words. Each pair forms a foursome with another pair to speak of the experience.

### Open Sentences on the Great Turning
1. To be alive now in this time of global crisis, what is hard for me…
2. What I appreciate about living in this time of global crisis is…
3. As I look at my life, it seems that I am taking part in the Great Turning - and some of the ways…

### The Wheel of the Great Turning
Each circular space becomes a wheel of the Great Turning. In each wheel, place three objects to symbolise the three dimensions of the Great Turning. For Holding Actions, some first-aid material (like rolls of bandaging) works well. For Transforming the Foundations of Our Common Life, use something organic and alive, like the leafy stalk of a growing plant. For the Shift in Perception and Values, perhaps a pair of eyeglasses. The wheel turns when people reach into the circle, one at a time, to pick up an object and report to the others something they are involved in or immediately acquainted with.

### The Elm Dance
People join hands in a circle dance. Latvian song by Ieva Akuratere. The dance became an expression of the people’s will to live. The dance helps us feel more fully our gratitude and grief.

## Honouring Our Pain For The World
+ acknowledging our pain for the world
+ validating it as a wholesome response
+ letting ourselves experience this pain
+ feeling OK about expressing it to others
+ recognising how widely it is shared by others
+ understanding that it springs from our caring and connectedness

### Small Groups on The Great Unravelling
Invite people to sit close in threes or fours and take turns reporting to each other in response to a single question: In what ways, in your own life, do you experience and observe the Great Unraveling?

### Open Sentences on Honouring our Pain
+ What concerns me most about the world today is…
+ When I see what’s happening to the natural world, what breaks my heart is…
+ When I see what’s happening to our society, what breaks my heart is…
+ When I think of the world we will leave our children, it looks like…
+ Feelings about all this, that I carry around with me, are…
+ Ways I avoid these feelings are…
+ Ways I use feelings are…

### Breathing Through
It makes it easier for people to take in distressing information.

### The Milling
The present global realities strike us with greater impact when we relate to our face-to-face experience of another person. Moving back chairs and cushions to make a large open space in the room, invite people to **mill**.
1. People are in industrial growth society.
2. Pace slows participants become aware of each other’s presence.
3. First encounter draws attention to the sheer presence of the other and their choice to be here.
4. Next we focus on the other’s unknown strengths and powers.
5. Next the focus moves to the other person’s knowledge of our present situation and their willingness to face it.
6. Next, the sense of touch is used to heighten awareness and imagination.
7. Final we acknowledge the danger each person faces in this planet-time and the gifts they can bring to ti.

### Reporting to Chief Seattle
Sitting in a circle, people take turns reading aloud significant portions of Seattle’s speech. he guide invites the group to imagine that Chief Seattle’s spirit is present at the centre of the circle. Speaking spontaneously at random, they can tell him now what has happened to his land: how we are treating it and each other and what life is like for us now. To give weight to each person’s words, the others can say simply, “Yes, it is so.”

### The Bestiary
This process provides a ritual structure for recalling what the Industrial Growth Society is doing to our fellow species. Listen as the Bestiary is read aloud. After the naming of each species, a clacker or a drum is struck in one strong beat. At the conclusion of the poem, the guide invites people to name things they notice are disappearing from the world.

### I Don’t Care
People sit in pairs and take turns speaking and listening to each other. A phrase to start off with is: I’m sick and tired of hearing about… Or Don’t talk to me about…Then let it go from there. The scene soon gets loud and often hilarious.

The second and last open sentence is: I don’t want to hear (or think) about all this, because it makes me feel…

### Cairn of Mourning
Invite people to wander outside, alone, calling to mind a particular part of their world, a place or being precious to them that is lost now or disappearing from their life. They find an object - say, a rock, a cluster of leaves, a stick - to symbolise what they mourn and bring it with them when they rejoin the group. One by one, at random, people arise, walk to the centre and place their object. As each offering is made and the objects pile up to form a heap or cairn, all in the circle serve as witnesses and acknowledge the speaker by saying, “We hear you.”

### Truth Mandala
People sit in a circle. They sit as closely-packed as possible, for they are creating a containment vessel for holding the truth. In each quadrant is placed a symbolic object: a stone, dead leaves, a thick stick and an empty bowl. In the centre is placed a small cloth. The stone is for fear. The dry leaves for sorrow. The stick is for anger. The empty bowl stands for our sense of deprivation and need. 
1. Once the ritual starts, one person at a time, randomly and spontaneously, steps into the circle and takes an object in their hands and speaks.
2. Encourage brevity in what is spoken.
3. To support the truth-telling, suggest a refrain “I hear you” or “I’m with you”

### Despair Ritual
At the outset everyone is standing and moving in the outer ring, which is the Circle of Reporting. The next is the Circle of Anger and Fear (with two cushions to pound on), and the innermost, a pile of pillows at the centre, is the Circle of Sorrow. Spontaneously they begin to make short comments about what is in their hearts and minds about the condition of the world.

### Bowl of Tears
People shared their grief for the world by passing a bowl of water around the circle, each person scooping up some water and letting it trickle through their fingers as they said, “My tears are for”. The bowl was then placed on the altar.

### Spontaneous Writing
Choose a word, a theme or phrase. Have them then take pen or pencil and write whatever comes to mind.

### Imaging with Colours and Clay
When we use colours on paper or model with clay, images surface; the tactile, visual engagement releases them. Acknowledge people’s hesitations. Many people, especially adults, feel dismay when asked to engage in any kind of artwork.

## Seeing with New Eyes
### The Systems Game
Have people stand in a circle within an open space.
1. Mentally select two other people, without indicating whom you have chosen.
2. Move so as to keep at all times an equal distance between you and each of these two people.

Shows self-regulating systems.

Variations: 
**Endangered Ecosystem**: Surreptitiously tap one person on the shoulder. After silently counting to five, this person will sink to the floor or squat down. 

**Social Innovation**: The groups starts sitting down. Secretly tap someone. This person silently counts to five and then rises, and so on.

**Social Restrictions**:  Immobilise 2 or more people. people may reflect on the diminished fluidity they sensed in the group.

### Riddle of the Commons Game (also Nuts Game)
A group of three or more players sit around a shallow unbreakable bowl that initially contains ten hardware nuts. An extra person, the Replenisher, sits with each group with a separate container of nuts nearby.
+ Each player’s goal is to get as many of the nuts as possible.
+ Players can take nuts form the bowl at any time. 
+ After each ten second interval the replenisher doubles the number of nuts remaining in the bowl.
+ This game ends if the bowl is empty, or continues until a predetermined time limits.

After first round of the game, allow the groups five minutes to invent their own rules in order to increase their harvests on a second game.

### When I Made a Difference
Think of a time in your life when something important and good happened because of what you said or did. Recapture the scene, play it back for yourself. Now in groups of three or four, people take turns telling their stories. The guide asks people to call out the qualities they discerned in each other’s stories

### Widening Circles of Four Voices
For context check out our page on: [Concentric Circles of Self][2].

People sit in groups of three or four. Ask them each to choose a particular issue or situation that concerns them. After a minute of silence, invite them to take turns speaking about their issue.

Each person will speak to their issue from four perspectives while the others in the group listen:
1. from their own point of view, including their feelings about the issue
2. from the perspective of a person who holds opposing views on this issue, introducing themselves and speaking as this person, using the pronoun I
3. from the viewpoint of a nonhuman being that is affected by that particular situation
4. lastly, in the voice of a future human whose life is affected by the choices made now on this issue

### The Cradling
People work in pairs, taking turns. First you model with a volunteer how Partners A lie down and Partners B, following your verbal suggestions, cradle them, which means lifting arms, lower legs and head.

Whatever words or images are used, it is good to touch on certain themes. These motifs renew and sharpen awareness of what it means to be a living person at this time in history. They include:
1. the uniqueness of the human species in the cosmos
2. our long evolutionary journey
3. the uniqueness of each individual and of each personal history
4. the intricacy and beauty of the human organism
5. its universality, linking us to other humans around the globe
6. and its vulnerability

### Who are you?
In pairs. Person A beings by asking: “Who are you?”. Then you listen. You ask again, “Who are you?” again you listen. You can vary the question: “What are you?”. After ten minutes shift to a second question: “What do you do?”. After the third bell. Give the third bell and go back to the first question.

### Dance to Dismember the Ego
Invite everyone to create their ego doll either with colours on paper or hunks of clay. Now comes the dance itself, or more precisely, a celebrate show-and-tell. One at a time, spontaneously, each person stands and parades around the circle displaying their ego doll for the admiration of all the others. As they do, they point out and extol its qualities while the group responds with extravagant praise. This adulation is important because egos love to be admired.

### Bodhisattva Check-In
First, tell about the bodhisattvas and their vow to keep returning to the world to relieve suffering. Secondly, invite the group to contemplate the long panoramic journey we have made as life on Earth. Third, invite everyone to imagine that we are all together somewhere in the larger body of Earth, in a timeless moment preceding our birth in this life. If and when you choose to take birth as a human in this era stand up. People begin slowly walking around the room, progressively owning the main circumstances of their present life.

### Council of All Beings
The participants take time alone to let themselves be chosen.
1. The guide invites participants to start moving as their life-form, beginning with eyes closed.
2. In groups of three or four, participants don their masks and practice using their human voice to speak for their adopted life-form.

Three stages of the Council:
1. Now, speaking at random, the beings express the particular concerns they bring to the council.
2. All the suffering that the beings describe seem to derive from the activities of one adolescent species.
3. Now each being has the chance to offer to the humans, and receive as a human when they come to the centre.
## Deep Time
TODO: Add Deep Time exercises.

## Going Forth
### Networking
Begin it by inviting people to stand at random (popcorn style) to name the issues and activities that they are called to. Then everyone can mingle and gather around particular themes.

### Communicating Our Concerns and Hopes
Have everyone assemble in pairs. Speakers, tell this person what you see, how you feel and what you feel impelled to do about it. Note any feelings of awkwardness, shame or powerlessness that may arise, and continue nonetheless. Partners respond in your role, keeping your replies fairly brief, so the burden of communication is on the speaker.

### Life Map
Instructions from the guide: Taking pen and paper, draw a map of your life’s journey up to now. Let it flow like a stream in a wandering line around the page, from your birth in this lifetime to the present moment. Along the line draw symbols or pictures to convey significant events that enriched or redirected the course of your life and your sense of its purpose. After 15 minutes invite people to share their maps in small groups.

### Imaging Our Power
Our sense of the power that is in us can be hard to convey in words. Close your eyes and breathe deeply for a moment or two â€¦ then try to sense what your power is like…. Let images and sensations emerge â€¦. Then take your paper and colours and begin to draw how that power feels or appears to you at this moment. Do this quickly, without too much thought.

### The Sword in the Stone
After telling the story. People can tell each other about those from whom they draw power.

### Callings and Resources
People work in pairs, taking turns. 
1. If you knew you could not fail, what would you do in service to life on Earth? Here is our chance to pull out the stops and think big, with no ifs or buts getting in the way.
2. In pursuing this vision, what particular project do you feel called to undertake?
3. What resources, inner and outer, do you now have that will help you do that?
4. Now what resources, inner and outer, will you need to acquire?
5. How might you stop yourself?
6. How will you move through or around with these obstacles?
7. What can you do in the next week, no matter how small the step?

### Consultation Groups
Each pair from the Callings and Resources practice now joins with another pair to make a group of four, bringing the notes of their plans. Where can you use some excellent advice? Is it to get clearer on your project and what you can achieve? Is it how to find the resources you need, or how to deal with particular obstacles?

### Corbett
People sit in groups of four. They are given some moments of silence for each person to select an important intention they would like to explore further. Then each of the four takes a turn, first describing their intention, and then hearing it addressed by the other three people in the group. Each of the other three speaks in turn from a different perspective. Going clockwise around the circle, these perspectives are: the voice of Doubt, the voice of a human ancestor and the voice of a future human.

### Clearness Committee
Traditionally, the seeker or focus person invites five or six trusted individuals (with as much diversity of relationship to the seeker as possible) and provides them beforehand a written description of the situation or choices he is facing. The Clearness Committee then meets for about three hours, with the possibility of continuing in a second or third meeting in subsequent weeks. One member agrees to serve as clerk (or facilitator), another as recorder - and everyone serves as prayerful listener and channel for clarifying questions.

### Dialoging with Mara to Strengthen Our Resolve
Form groups of three. Each person takes a turn as the focus person for 15 minutes, while the other two people are listening allies in this dialogue with Mara. The focus person uses two cushions, sitting on one and facing the other.
Cushion One is the place of intention/resolve/determination. Cushion Two is Mara. The focus person starts in the place of resolve, telling the two witnesses of something she intends to put into action on returning home. The focus person moves onto Cushion Two and becomes Mara, voicing fears, doubts and criticisms

### Bowing to Our Adversaries
Everyone stands with enough room in front of them to kneel and touch the ground with hands and forehead. We begin by bowing to the Earth, in gratitude for life itself. Then we bow to the ancestors and teachers we revere, and, after that, to all our companions in the Great Turning. Now the bows to our adversaries begin.

### Five Vows
On the last evening or last day, a simple ritual is held. With everyone standing, the guide recites each vow, asking the people if they wish to take that vow.

### Circle of Blessings
One at a time, each person steps forward into the circle and declares a particular action or path they intend to pursue. The full circle responds by singing the person’s name several times and with spontaneous words of affirmation and encouragement.
