# Bioharmony

Bioharmony is the goal of making systems operate in total integration with the living, natural world.

The popular concept of biomimicry implies a split between humans and nature. This perspective of separation contributes to our capacity for destructively exploiting non-human organisms and ecosystems. 

But really, humans are nature, through and through. We have emerged from and are continually sustained by - indeed, are indistinguishable from - organic nature. We shouldn’t aim for biomimicry, but _bioharmony_: a state where humans consciously know that they are nature, and as a result are fully respectful of their interdependence and inseparability with all other life. 

## Bioharmony Principles

To do this they should follow the bioharmony principles:

### Subsidiarity
Powers and responsibilities are handed to the smallest political unit that can reasonably discharge them.
