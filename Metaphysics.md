# Metaphysics
## Key Terms
3 Parts of Metaphysics (what is there and what is it like?):
* Ontology: What exists?
* Epistemology: What is knowledge?
* Cosmology: What is the cosmos? (the whole)

## Key New Ideas
* Metaphysical Mono-culturing: modernism fixates on one set of metaphysics.
* Metaphysics is pre-science and a-priori.
* New types of metaphysics might allow us to confront today’s crises.
* Guerrilla Ontology: let’s experiment with new ontologies! (and other parts of metaphysics)
