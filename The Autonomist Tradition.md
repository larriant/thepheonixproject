# The Autonomist Tradition

**The Reversal of Perspective.**

Two narratives about history in Marx.

History is about class struggle.

History is about the forces of production (i.e. Technological Determinism)

Is it class struggle or the forces of production that change things?

There is nothing inevitable about the way that technology is deployed.

Really it is the actions and structures of workers that drive capitalism’s changes.

**Antonio Negri**

Empire: the international distribution of capitalist power.

Multitude opposes Empire. 

A multitude is all of us. To the extent to which we are all engage in a set of creative and communal activities.

Capitalism always has to create situations and sites of collective activities.

If you create sites of collective activities it doesn’t mean you get to sell the products.

Capitalists must find a way to trick, exploit the multitude into making products.

Contemporary Capitalism relies on the creative and communal energy of millions of people.

Immaterial Labour: contemporary forms of work don’t produce any material objets.

Neoliberalism’s great success is ability to capture new desires.

The home of the multitude is the Metropolis. 

Capitalist class always keen to control cities.
