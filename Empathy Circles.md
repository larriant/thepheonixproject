## How it Works
+ Group should have 2 to 6 participants (4 is ideal). 8+ is an Empathy Café.
+ Participants must agree to stay in the process.
+ What topics might be discussed? ANY! What is alive in the moment?
+ Speaker Time: 3 to 5 minutes is a good starting point.
+ Empathy Circle Length: 2 hours works well

Roles:
+ Speaker
+ Active Listener
+ Silent Listener
+ Facilitator (organises and schedules the circle. Timekeeping.)

Starting the Circle:
+ Welcome Participants
+ Introductions (name, where they’re from, something personal)
+ Reviews Process
+ Announces the Topic
+ Sets Speaker Time Limits
+ Ask, who would like to start as the first speaker?
+ The Speaker selects who they want to be the active listener
+ Say an idea or two. Then active listener can recap their understanding.
+ Cycle of speaking and active listening continues until the speaker feels fully heard or time is up.
+ Then the active listener becomes the speaker.
