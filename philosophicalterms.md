# Philosophical Terms

3 Parts of Metaphysics (what is there and what is it like?):
* Ontology: What exists?
* Epistemology: What is knowledge?
* Cosmology: What is the cosmos? (the whole)

Philosophical Realism: view that objects exist in reality independent of our conceptual scheme. (the world is mind independent)

Philosophical Relativism: knowledge is always historically, socially, and culturally situated.

Naturalism: idea that only natural as opposed to supernatural or spiritual laws and forces operate in the world.

Hermeneutics: the study of interpretation.

* Normative: making claims about what is right and wrong. 
* Positive: factual statements that attempt to describe reality. 

Linguistic Relativity (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis): the structure of a speaker’s language affects its speakers’ world-view or cognition.

# Ontology

Object-oriented ontology: rejects the human privileging of human existence over non-human objects

[Speculative Realism][1]: 

[Transcendental Materialism][2]

# Epistemology
Regress Problem: how can we eventually terminate a logical argument with some statement(s) that do not require further justification but can still be considered rational and justified?

Foundationalism: certain "foundations" or "basic beliefs" support other beliefs but do not themselves require justification from other beliefs.

Coherentism: an individual belief is justified circularly by the way it fits together (coheres) with the rest of the belief system

# Free Will
Determinism: all events are ‘determined’ by previously existing courses.

Compatibilism: Free Will and Determinism are compatible. i.e. both can be true. 

# Religion
Ecumenical: aimed at achieving unity of the religion. Inter-denominational

# Psychology
Constructivism: The idea that humans construct or create their own realities.
