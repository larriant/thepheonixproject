# The Fluid Mode

Eternalism vs Nihilism
Pattern vs Nebulosity


The fluid mode “understands meaning as a dynamic process of evolution through social, cultural, and psychological change.”

## Liquid Mind
Thorsom believes that Chapman’s fluid mode is a natural expression of the **Liquid Mind**.

The Liquid Mind is achieved through seeing the emptiness of all things.

Emptiness is the idea that what reality is like, is dependent on our [Way of Seeing][1].

Thorsom says that “the more we get to know the empty nature of all things, the more fluidity we achieve and embody.”
