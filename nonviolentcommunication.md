# Non Violent Communication

The fundamental idea of NVC is that human conflict comes from unfulfilled needs.

These needs cause feelings and thoughts which then lead to violent communication.

**Needs -\> Feelings / Thoughts -\> Violent Communication**

NVC suggests that we should try and listen for the underlying feelings, needs and requests people are making whether they come in a “violent” form or not.


## How to Express Honestly
### 1. Express an observation. (specific to time and content) Don’t generalise.
**Don’t say**: You never listen to me. **Say**: You didn’t seem to be listening to me when I was telling you about my troubles at work.

The important thing here is differentiating observation from evaluation. You’re not saying the problem is inherent to the other person. This would only make them defensive. But instead you just express a single observation.

### 2. Explain how you are feeling in relation to what you observe.
**Don’t say**: It makes me think that you don’t love me. **Say**: It makes me feel unloved.
The key part is to separate feeling from thinking. Thinking implies judgement, criticism or blame. You’re not saying it was wrong for them not to be listening. But just how it personally effected you.

### 3. Explain what you need or value (rather than a preference) that causes your feelings.

**Say**: I need re-assurance and love in my life.

### 4. Request the concrete actions I would like taken.
**Say**: Would you be willing to try to pay more attention to me next time I’m trying to get stuff off my chest?

We should clearly request what we would like to happen without demanding it. This leaves the other person the option to refuse.
