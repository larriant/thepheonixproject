# Ways of Seeing

One example of the [transjective perspective][1] is Rob Burbea’s **Ways of Seeing**.

TODO: add more key ideas from Burbea’s Ways of Seeing?

* [The Three Characteristics of Buddhism][2] are ‘ways of looking’ that reduce suffering rather than being truth claims about how the world is.
* We are always using a ‘way of looking’. It is stupid to talk about “being with the world ‘as it is’“.
* We can see meditation as a form of experimenting with ways of looking. What happens if I look in this way?
* Maybe there are other ways of looking (such as Burbea’s Imaginal approach) that fabricate better realities rather than just deconstructing.

## Spiritual Bypassing
"Spiritual bypassing" is a term first coined by psychotherapist John Welwood to describe how people frequently use their beliefs in spiritual transcendence to bypass their own serious emotional and relationship issues.
