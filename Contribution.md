# Contribution

## Why Contribution?
Thought: the world’s biggest problem is that most people are dismissing and ignoring the world’s biggest problems! This tendency usually occurs from a place of self-preoccupation - ultimately a lack of consideration for other people, animals and the environment. Most people are concerned with their problems only, and so we have a global culture of competition. The mindset of altruism is important because it can change the way that people act towards our shared problems, as well as those smaller of other individuals. If everybody began to actively realise their capacity for unconditional friendliness and benevolence, altruistic actions and thus cooperation towards solving the world’s problems would ensue naturally and rapidly. In this way we can catalyse a shift to a global culture of cooperation and compassion.

Above making altruists, there is the notion of unlocking altruists! Think how many people - particularly the young - are desperate to help and contribute, but lack the value-system for doing so (altruism) as well as the concrete opportunities to do so. These individuals need an educational organisation that will guide them towards why and how to live a life of altruism.


## How to Contribute?
Thought exercise: **Altruism Streams**. 

What are the different ways we can help people, and to help them help others?
* **Anarchism, community, autonomy**: helping others organise non-hierarchically, autonomously, democratically, without centralised and coercive authorities. Helping them work, live and share as communities.
* **Giving and sharing**: helping people to better follow their altruistic motivations and to identify ways they can help others
* **Psychology**: helping others attain happiness and peace of mind, and to realise their innate capacity for limitless altruism. Liberation from maladaptive thought patterns such as materialism/consumerism, patriarchy, power structures, competition… (what else?). Meditation, psychedelics, yoga, Wim Hof, neurohacking, journaling, etc. as key things to share in this stream.
* **Creativity**: helping others know the joys of creating - particularly in group/interactive/participatory contexts. (Burning man as example)
* **Rationality**: giving people the invaluable tools of the scientific method and evidence-based reasoning.
Financial and material. Self-explanatory. The current focus of modern philanthropy / charity.
* **Environmental**? Help people benefit the environment more, be more sustainable and self-sufficient
… ?
Also **political engagement** can be an important way to make change happen and help people.
Note: Burning man events help people in all 5 of anarchism, giving, psychology, environmental and creativity streams!

## Science of Contribution
### Cooperative behaviour cascades in human social networks
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851803/pdf/pnas.200913149.pdf 

… altruism cascades! Some highlights:

“We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members’ contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence.”

“In the particular case of cooperation or altruistic behavior, it is well known that one person’s altruism toward another can elicit reciprocal altruism in repeated paired interactions (direct reciprocity) (30) and also in groups (31, 32). Indeed, many individuals are “conditional cooperators” who give more if others give more and who are influenced in their interactions with others by what the others are doing during the interaction (33, 34). It also is well known that reputation mechanisms that provide information about a person’s past behavior can help sustain cooperation (indirect reciprocity) (35).”

“This multiplier effect also suggests that behavioral imitation and interpersonal spread may be an important factor in the evolution of cooperation in humans. For example, cascades of cooperative (or non-cooperative) behavior can promote coordination on a particular strategy, possibly decreasing within-group variance.”

“Cascades also may help mitigate the negative effect of group size on cooperation (11, 42) because they reduce the number of independent entities in a population, effectively increasing the size of groups in which public goods can be maintained via self-interest. ”

“(i) behavior can spread from person to person to person to person via a diverse set of mechanisms, subject to certain constraints, and (ii) as a result, each person in a network can influence dozens or even hundreds of people, some of whom he or she does not know and has not met.”

## Altruism Ideas
Random ideas we've had over the months that it seemed important to capture:

* Give a few public talks / presentations on altruism/our ideas
* Run an altruism workshop - discussion group - day course
* Make an altruism mini-documentary
* Website and facebook group/page - starting a digitally connected altruism community
* “Let’s make Utrecht amazing” event
* Burn / anarchist day/evening event, e.g. a really really free market
* Start to build a wiki of resources for aspiring altruists.
* ….?

Other ideas:
* Crowdfund a small project: just to get an idea of how it works and the potential behind it. This experience could be very valuable later on. 
* Unlocking Creativity event with psilocybin truffles
* Organise a metta meditation class, perhaps find a senior meditator to teach this
* Combining metta meditation with MDMA ?
* Meetup: existential cafe open discussion group
* Modern Altruism HowTo ebook (contains everything in this document, basically) 
* Art Installation Idea: some way of putting all our collected altruism quotes (see bottom of doc) into a public space, to inspire people. We could also add a rotating quote feature to our website / wiki. 
* Altruism Hackathon. Helpathon? Gather a load of people and go into teams to make cool social enterprise type things.
* …?

Later down the road:
* Altruism day/weekend course
* Altruism Conference
* Altruism Center
* Place where people can go to find their purpose. / Altruism Retreats

Funding it All
* Public donations: patreon, crowdfunding
* Giving altruism courses and asking for a reasonable fee OR an optional donation
* Altruism coaching service. Help others find meaning and fulfillment in altruistic causes. Almost like altruism therapy!
* Finding a product or service to sell… 
* Some form of social enterprise (like an altruism coffee shop where we employ homeless people). Could be a good way of learning a lot of things that we can then spread to the world through coaching etc.
* … ? 


Altruism Day:
* Begin with metta meditation / yoga / other practices.
* Then have a talk from Jules + Will about our altruism NGO / why altruism is important? Basically give our altruism manifesto in talk form
Then either:
* A day of brainstorming building projects in local (Utrecht?) community;
* A day of personal and communal discovery of what we can uniquely contribute.
* Find existing projects and go help them! We should look to collaborate with others as much as possible.
* End with socialising (cannabis, beers?) and group flow activities like IGO + Group Art + Group Improv.

Altruists referred to as "light-workers" or the general heart-set as one of "STO: service to others" (as opposed to dark-workers or service to self).

Small-world network means that if you create a positive ripple that goes 6 degrees out, you hit pretty much everyone, no :)?
