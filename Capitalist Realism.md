# Capitalist Realism
Capitalist Realism is the widespread idea that capitalism is the only “realistic” political economic system.

Fischer argues that this idea has become a major legitimising prop of the neoliberal order we live in. 

With the disappearance of the Eastern Block, capitalism was free to present itself as ‘the only game in town’.

The idea of any practical alternative to capitalism becomes not just ‘unrealistic’ but literally unthinkable.

## The Future
Capitalist Realism announces that we have reached the ‘end of history’ and, in so doing, obliterates any sense of time as a constantly progressing continuum. Instead we live in an eternal present.

## Results
Capitalist realism’s eternal present gives rise to a collective social and cultural malaise.

Contemporary individuals, for Fisher, inhabit a melancholy and sterile world stripped of hope. 

This is a deeply unhealthy state of affairs in psychological terms which gives rise to profound anxieties and neuroses at both an individual and social level.

## Aporia’s in Capitalist Realism
The way to combat capitalist realism is to identify and tease out its gaps, tensions and contradictions.

**Mental Health**
+ We are made to think that mental health is an individual problem.
+ In fact today’s burgeoning rates of depression and other forms of mental illness are largely socially and structurally generated. 
+ So they cry out for radical social and political solutions.

**Bureaucracy**
+ Capitalist Realism leaves us awash in a sea of new forms of bureaucracy.
+ The left should build on the desires for a massive reduction of bureaucracy that neoliberalism tapped into but has been incapable of satisfying.
