# Ways of Seeing

TODO: add more key ideas from Burbea’s Ways of Seeing?

* [The Three Characteristics of Buddhism][1] are ‘ways of looking’ that reduce suffering rather than being truth claims about how the world is.
* We are always using a ‘way of looking’. It is stupid to talk about “being with the world ‘as it is’“.

## Burbea’s Dharma Talks
* [Ikon and Idos][2]
* [What is Awakening?][3]
* [The Theatre of Selves][4]
* [Approaching the Dharma][5] (part 1-2)
* [Image, Mythos, Dharma][6] (part 1-3)
* [An Ecology of Love][7] (parts 1-4)
* [The Path of the Imaginal][8] (longer course)
* [Re-enchanting the Cosmos: The Poetry of Perception][9] (longer course)
* [Eros Unfettered][10] (longer course)
* [Foundations of a Soul Making Dharma][11] (longer course)
