# Methodologies for working with groups

### 1. The Circle Way

https://www.thecircleway.net/

What transforms a meeting into a circle is the willingness of people to shift from informal socializing or opinionated discussion into a receptive attitude of thoughtful speaking and deep listening.

#### Components of Circle

+ Intention - shapes the circle and determines who will come, how long the circle will meet, and what kinds of outcomes are to be expected. The caller of the circle spends time articulating intention and invitation.
+ Start-Point Or Welcome - Gesture to shift people's attention from social space to council space. Gesture may be a moment of silence, reading a poem or listening to a song.
+ Setting the Circle - The center of the circle should hold an object that represents the intention of the circle. Any symbol fits this purpose: flowers, a bowl or basket, a candle.
+ Check-In / Greeting - Check-in helps people into a frame of mind for council and reminds everyone of their commitment to the expressed intention. Very sharing, especially a brief story, weaves the interpersonal net.
+ Guardian - the single most important tool for aiding self-governance and bringing circle back to intention is the role of guardian.  One circle member volunteers to watch and safeguard group energy and observe the circle's process. The guardian usually employs a gentle noise-maker such as a chime that signals to everyone to stop aciton, take a breath, rest in a space of slience. Any member may call for a pause.
+ Setting Circle Agreements - Agreements often used include: we hold all stories or personal material in confidentiality. We listen to each other with compassion and curiosity. We ask for what we need and offer what we can.
+ Three Principles 
	1) *Leadership rotates* among all circle members
	2) *Responsibility is shared* for the quality of experience
	3) *Reliance is on wholeness*, rather than on any personal agenda

+ The Practices
	1) *Speak with intention*: noting what has relevance to the conversation in the moment
	2) *Listen with attention*: respectful of the learning process for all members of the group
	3) *Tend to the well being of the circle*: remaining aware of the impact of our contributions

+ Forms of Council
	1) *Talking piece council* is often used as a part of check-in, check-out and whenever there is a desire to slow down the conversation, collect all voices and contributions and be able to speak without interruption.
	2) *Conversation Council* is often used when reaction, interaction and an interjection of new ideas, thoughts and opinions are needed.
	3) *Reflection, or silent council* gives each member time and space to reflect on what is occurring, or needs to occur, in the course of a meeting. Silence may be called so that each person can consider the role or impact they are having on the group, or to help the group realign with their intention, or to sit with a question until there is clarity.
	  
+ Check-out and Farewell - it is important to allow a few minutes for each person to comment on what they learned, or what stays in their heart and mind as they leave. Provides a formal end to the meeting.

### 2. World Café Method

http://www.theworldcafe.com/key-concepts-resources/world-cafe-method/

1) *Setting*: Create a 'special' environment, most often modeled after a café, i.e. small round tables covered with a checkered or white linen tablecloth, butcher block paper, colored pens, a vase of flowers and "talking stick" item.

2) *Welcome and Introduction*: the host begins with a warm welcome and an introduction to the world café process, setting the context, shareing the Café Ettiquette and putting participants at ease.

3) *Small Group Rounds*: three of more twenty minute rounds of conversation for the small group seated around a table. At the end of the twenty minutes, each member of the group moves to a different new table. They may or may not choose to leave one person as the "table host" for the next round, who welcomes the next group and briefly fills them in on what happened in the previous round.

4) *Questions*: each round is preface with a question specially crafted for the specific context and desired purspose of the World Café.

5) *Harvest*: After the small groups, individuals are invited to share insights or other results from their conversations with the rest of the large group. These are reflected visually in a variety of ways, most often using graphic recording in the front of the room.

Graphic Recording: capturing people's ideas and expressions - in words, images and color - as they are being spoken in the moment.

### 3. Open Space World

http://openspaceworld.org/wp2/

The theme or purpose on which we’ve been invited to work was open, broad, and demands a creative, collective response. The

The big empty wall is in fact our agenda. He reassures us that it will, within the hour, be filled with discussion topics related to the theme.

Four Principles

1) “Whoever comes is the right people” acknowledges that the only people really qualified or able to do great work on any issue are those who really care, and freely choose to be involved. 

2) “Whenever it starts is the right time” recognizes that spirit and creativity don’t run on the clock, so while we’re here, we’ll all keep a vigilant watch for great ideas and new insights, which can happen at anytime.

3) “Whatever happens is the only thing that could have” allows everyone to let go of the could haves, would haves and should haves, so that we can give our full attention to the reality of what is happening, is working, and is possible right now. 
4) “When it’s over, it’s over” acknowledges that you never know just how long it’ll take to deal with a given issue, and reminds us that getting the work done is more important than sticking to an arbitrary schedule.


The one law is The Law of Two Feet, or in some cases, The Law of Personal Mobility. It says simply that you, and only you, know where you can learn and contribute the most to the work that must take place today. It demands that you use your two feet to go where you need to go and do what you need to do.

The facilitator invites anyone who’s ready to come to the center of the cirle, grab a market and a sheet of paper and write down their burning question, passionate issue, or great idea.

"My name is \_\_\_\_, my issue is \_\_\_\_\_"

They tape their sheet to the wall and assign it a place and a time (from a pre-arranged set of space/time choices).

Minutes later, the first sessions start without any announcement or instructions, because every body knows where they need to be.

Suddenly the large circle is many small circles, in the corners of the room, or in separate breakout spaces each working on some important part of the main theme. Every session has been proposed by someone who really cares about that item and has taken responsibility for making sure it gets addressed.

In some events the proceedings are captured by computer. The person convenes a session also takes responsibility for capturing the notes and typing them into the computer. The rule-of-thumb is that one day in Open Space will get you a lot of great discussion, two days will give you time to capture what happens in a typed proceedings documents, and a third day (usually a half-day ) will allow a more formal convergence to specific plans for immediate action.

In the closing circle, everyone in the room attests to the fact that, together we have done what most thought was impossible.

### 4. Appreciative Inquiry

https://appreciativeinquiry.champlain.edu/learn/appreciative-inquiry-introduction/

#### 5 Principles:

1) Constructionist Principle (words create worlds) - reality as we know it is a subjective vs objective state and is sociall created through language and conversations.

2) Simultaneity Principle (inquiry creates change) - the moment we ask a question, we begin to create a change. "The questions we ask are fateful".

3) Poetic Principle (We can choose what we study) - Teams and organizations, like open books, are endless sources of study and learning. What we choose to study makes a difference. It describes even creates - the world as we know it.

4) Anticipatory Principle (Images inspire action) - Human systems move in the direction of their images of the future. The more positive and hopeful the image of the future, the more positive the present-day action.

5) Positive Principle (Positive questions lead to positive change) - Momentum for (small or) large scale change requires large amounts of positive affect and social bonding. This momentum is best generated through positive questions that amplify the positive core.

#### 5D Cycle
1. Define - What is the topic of inquiry? - what the system wants more of. What generative topic do we want to focus on together?

2. Discover - Appreciating the best of 'what is' - Discovery is based on dialogue, as a way of finding 'what works'. 
3. Dream - Imagining 'what could be' - Imagining uses past achievements, and succeses identified in the discovery phase to imagine new possiblities and envisage a preferred future.

4. Design - Determining 'what should be' - Design brings together the stories from discovery with the imagination and creativity from deam. The best of what is with what might be. To create What should be - the ideal.

5. Delivery/Destiny - Creating 'what will be' - the fifth stage in the 5Ds process indentifies how the design is delivered, and how it's embedded into groups, communities and organizations.
