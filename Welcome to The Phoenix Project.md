## Welcome to The Phoenix Project

The Phoenix Project was created by Julyan Davey and Will Franks. 

You can read more about it on our [website][1].

This wiki contains a record of our explorations into our society, it’s problems and how we can imagine an alternative.

## Our Metaphors
We heavily make use of two metaphors:

The **Monster Factory** (coined by Vinay Gupta) is our present society. It destroys our [environment][2], leads to gross [inequalities][3] of money and power and contributes to a great deal of [alienation][4] from self, other and environment. 

The **Phoenix** is the society we hope arises from the ashes of our present civilisation. 

Nobody knows exactly what the Phoenix will look like. But we believe if we look closely we can see some feathers of the phoenix already emerging.

# Who are we?
Trained in physics and philosophy, Will and Julyan escaped London’s consumer dystopia to hitchhike through Europe writing poetry and philosophy, dropping in on festivals and academic conferences… only to return to help organise Extinction Rebellion’s street-occupation protest-festivals and launch a nomadic community project by squatting an empty grammar school.
